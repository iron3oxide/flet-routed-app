# fletched

An opinionated framework on top of flet,
designed to significantly reduce boilerplate code
and aid in structuring a non-trivial project.

If flet were an arrow,
fletched would give it feathers,
enabling you to aim and hit way further.

For now, it offers three libraries/submodules:
`mvp`, `routed_app` and `controls`.
They are designed to work in conjunction,
but should you only want to use one of them,
that should work just as well.

Should the site ever be unavailable,
the Markdown files used to build them can be found
and read in the `docs/` directory.

# fletched

An opinionated framework on top of flet,
designed to significantly reduce boilerplate code
and aid in structuring a non-trivial project.

If flet were an arrow,
fletched would give it feathers,
enabling you to aim and hit way further.

For now, it offers two libraries/submodules:
`mvp` and `routed_app`,
which were originally separate projects.
They are designed to work well in conjunction,
but should you only want to use one of them,
that will work as well.

:book: [Read the documentation](https://iron3oxide.github.io/fletched/) <br>
Should the site ever be unavailable,
the Markdown files used to build them can be found
and read in the `docs/` directory.
